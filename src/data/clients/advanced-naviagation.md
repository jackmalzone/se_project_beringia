## 2. Unique selling points for the supported solutions.

### Hydrus

Hydrus is a hovering micro autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) revolutionising underwater data collection across reef monitoring and subsea inspections.

**Core Features**:

- Fully autonomous - Hydrus incorporates the most advanced navigation and communication systems of any subsea vehicle. It contains a DVL, USBL, INS and acoustic modem, all tightly integrated. This enables highly reliable, fully autonomous underwater missions at your fingertips. It also provides obstacle detection and collision avoidance.
- High-quality data - Featuring advanced sensors and a 4K camera, Hydrus delivers accurate, georeferenced video and imagery for 3D surveying and photogrammetry.
- Compact and lightweight - Weighing 15 lbs and about the size of a basketball, Hydrus eliminates the need for large vessels, professional dive teams and qualified user training.
- Hand deployable - Hydrus can be launched off a small boat by a single person and easily retrieved upon return, saving valuable time for data collection.

### Subsonus

Subsonus is a miniature underwater acoustic positioning system that provides high accuracy position, velocity, and heading at ranges of up to 1000 meters.

**Core Features**:

- USBL2 Configuration - Subsonus is based on a unique, next-generation USBL configuration option known as “USBL-squared” (USBL2). The primary difference to traditional configurations is having a transducer on both the surface vessel and tracked object. This multi-transducer architecture greatly simplifies and reduces the costs and complexity involved with capturing full high-accuracy motion data of underwater tracked objects and delivers unprecedented availability in shallow and difficult water conditions.
- Integrated Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) - Subsonus contains a high specification inertial sensor alongside its hydrophone array and acoustic sounder. The INS provides roll, pitch, magnetic and gyroscopic heading, heave and acceleration data of the unit, allowing high accuracy dead-reckoning capability in full six-degrees of freedom (6DoF). Data from the inertial sensors is fused and processed using Advanced Navigation’s sophisticated algorithmic technology.
- Industry-leading Hydrophone Array - Subsonus features an industry-leading eight-channel factory-calibrated hydrophone array. With the hydrophones, Subsonus is able to perform beamforming, offering exceptional multipath rejection in poor environments and higher accuracy measurements.
- Dynamic Power And Signal Encoding - Subsonus dynamically adjusts its acoustic transmit power and signal encoding based upon its operating environment. This results in highly improved performance and reliability in difficult conditions.
- Acoustic Heading - Subsonus features acoustic heading transfer technology that allows it to transfer high-accuracy GNSS heading from the surface to a unit underwater. This allows underwater units to achieve high accuracy heading without a gyrocompass and with no susceptibility to magnetic interference.
- Internal Speed Of Sound - Subsonus has the ability to measure the speed of sound through water using a revolutionary new technique. This means that the system is self-tuning and no extra equipment or user intervention is required to set up the system for optimal performance.
- Fully Integrated Miniature Enclosure - Subsonus utilizes modern high-end electronics and manufacturing techniques to miniaturize the physical components of the USBL system, without compromising on performance. Subsonus runs fully on the processor within the transceiver, and is accessible via a web browser, with no additional rack-mounted interface units or processing PCs.
- Acoustic Modem - Subsonus offers acoustic modem functionality, capable of rapidly transmitting third-party data via a TCP Network port from one subsonus to another.

### Subsonus Tag

Subsonus Tag is an acoustic positioning transponder that operates with the Subsonus USBL.

**Core Features**:

- Ultra-Long Battery Life - Subsonus Tag features a revolutionary acoustic processing architecture that allows it to achieve a durable battery life of up to 18 months in slow update applications.
- Multi-track Technology - Multiple Subsonus Tags can be deployed in the same area and tracked using one surface Subsonus unit. Each tag has a unique address and can be assigned a name for easy identification.
- Integrated Display - Subsonus Tag features a pressure tolerant display that allows divers to receive and respond to messages from the surface. The electronic paper technology consumes no power between updates of the screen graphics.
- Hermetically Sealed - The revolutionary design of Subsonus Tag features total encapsulation of the electronics and batteries. This offers unparalleled reliability with no servicing required.
- Completely Wireless - Subsonus Tag contains a Qi compatible wireless power receiver for convenient battery charging without using connectors. Tags can be quickly configured and updated from a smartphone using bluetooth.
