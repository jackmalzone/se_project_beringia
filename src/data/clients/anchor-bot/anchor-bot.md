# Anchorbot Marine

The world's first underwater robot for precision anchor installation. Our innovative ROV system installs helical anchors efficiently and accurately at depths up to 100m, revolutionizing marine anchoring for aquaculture, floating solar, marinas, and ocean energy projects.

## Core Benefits

- Cost-effective alternative to traditional gravity/drag anchors
- Operates in depths up to 100m in challenging conditions
- No divers required - safer operations
- Precise GPS-guided placement
- Compatible with most sediment types
- Pre-attached anchor lines without proof-loading
- Reduced environmental impact
- Smaller vessel requirements

## How It Works

1. **Deployment**: Anchorbot ROV is launched from a standard work boat
2. **Navigation**: Precision GPS guidance to installation location
3. **Installation**: Robot installs helical anchor while recording torque data
4. **Recovery**: Returns to surface with anchor line attached

## Applications

- Aquaculture farms
- Floating solar arrays
- Marina expansions
- Navigation buoys
- Floating docks
- Ocean energy systems
- Research installations

## Client Testimonial

"The Anchorbot is a low cost, efficient system to deploy helical anchors in deep water. We used the Anchorbot to help deploy a 1 acre, offshore kelp farm in Maine. The helical anchors reduced the scope of the farm and allowed us to produce more kelp in a smaller area. Look forward to working with the anchoring device as we deploy a new shellfish/macroalgae farm offshore NH in 2024."
â€” Michael Chambers, University of New Hampshire
