# Mission Robotics: Innovating Marine Robotics with Advanced Software and Hardware

## Company Overview and Mission

Mission Robotics is a California-based company founded in 2020 by a team of veteran ROV engineers (former leads at OpenROV) with a clear goal: accelerate innovation in marine robotics ([About - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/about/#:~:text=Mission%20Robotics%20is%20the%20brainchild,ROVs%2C%20AUVs%2C%20USVs%2C%20and%20more)) ([ROS2 Embarks on a Mission to the Bottom of Lake Tahoe - Maritime Robotics - ROS Discourse](https://discourse.ros.org/t/ros2-embarks-on-a-mission-to-the-bottom-of-lake-tahoe/17139#:~:text=To%20provide%20a%20bit%20of,technology%20in%20the%20marine%20space)). The co-founders – Brian Grau (CEO), Charles Cross (CTO), and Walt Holm (Director of Engineering) – bring decades of experience in ROV development, aerospace, and autonomous vehicles ([About - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/about/#:~:text=Mission%20Robotics%20is%20the%20brainchild,ROVs%2C%20AUVs%2C%20USVs%2C%20and%20more)). Their mission is to develop **hardware and software products that make it easier and faster to build and deploy marine robots**, including Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs), Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs), Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs), and related systems ([About - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/about/#:~:text=Together%2C%20the%20trio%20combines%20a,ROVs%2C%20AUVs%2C%20USVs%2C%20and%20more)). By providing a modern, open, and extensible platform, Mission Robotics aims to let users “focus on your mission, not the tools,” effectively lowering the barrier to entry for advanced marine robotics ([Home Page - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/#:~:text=About%20Us)) ([Home Page - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/#:~:text=SOLUTIONS)). This vision of **making marine technology more accessible** is reflected in their products, which integrate state-of-the-art computing with robust control software to enable faster development cycles and deployment in challenging underwater environments ([ROS2 Embarks on a Mission to the Bottom of Lake Tahoe - Maritime Robotics - ROS Discourse](https://discourse.ros.org/t/ros2-embarks-on-a-mission-to-the-bottom-of-lake-tahoe/17139#:~:text=To%20provide%20a%20bit%20of,technology%20in%20the%20marine%20space)) ([Home Page - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/#:~:text=SOLUTIONS)).

## Software Solutions and Architecture

Mission Robotics has developed a comprehensive software stack, often referred to as a **“Vehicle OS & Pilot” control software**, designed specifically for marine vehicles. This software platform is built on modern open standards like ROS 2 and the Data Distribution Service (DDS) for real-time communication ([ROS2 Embarks on a Mission to the Bottom of Lake Tahoe - Maritime Robotics - ROS Discourse](https://discourse.ros.org/t/ros2-embarks-on-a-mission-to-the-bottom-of-lake-tahoe/17139#:~:text=On%20the%20software%20front%2C%20we,achieved%20via%20building%20from%20source)) ([Solutions - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/solutions/#:~:text=,your%20programs%20to%20our%20system)). In fact, the company created a custom OS distribution and framework on ROS 2 Foxy, using Eclipse Cyclone DDS as the primary communications middleware due to its performance and reliability in their applications ([ROS2 Embarks on a Mission to the Bottom of Lake Tahoe - Maritime Robotics - ROS Discourse](https://discourse.ros.org/t/ros2-embarks-on-a-mission-to-the-bottom-of-lake-tahoe/17139#:~:text=On%20the%20software%20front%2C%20we,achieved%20via%20building%20from%20source)). By leveraging DDS (a publish/subscribe protocol), the system exposes a full vehicle API so that **every sensor reading, actuator command, and status message is available on a data bus**. This allows developers to interface their own programs or even ROS 2 packages with the vehicle easily ([New Product - BlueROV2 Full Electronics and Software Upgrade - Third Party Products - Blue Robotics Community Forums](https://discuss.bluerobotics.com/t/new-product-bluerov2-full-electronics-and-software-upgrade/10652#:~:text=,Nano%2C%20which%20has%20substantially%20more)). Charles Cross (CTO) noted that using advanced DDS features (like RTI Connext 6.1’s WAN transport) enabled Mission Robotics to stand up a remote-control demo “in only three hours,” underscoring how the software’s architecture simplifies complex connectivity challenges ([RTI Announces the First Software Framework Designed for Widely Distributed Autonomous Systems](https://www.rti.com/news/rti-announces-software-framework-for-widely-autonomous-systems#:~:text=,is%20an%20absolute%20game%20changer)).

**Key capabilities of the software include:** real-time vehicle control modes, data logging, a user-friendly pilot interface, and remote operation features. The control system supports all fundamental ROV functions such as manual piloting, depth hold, altitude hold, and magnetic heading hold, with an IMU-driven attitude stabilization loop ([Solutions - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/solutions/#:~:text=Basic%20Control)). It also introduces advanced modes like gyro-stabilized heading, **arbitrary attitude hold** (ability to stabilize the ROV at any orientation), and is working toward true position hold and waypoint navigation ([Solutions - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/solutions/#:~:text=Advanced%20Control%20Modes)). Notably, the control loops automatically adapt to different sensor setups without requiring time-consuming retuning when hardware changes ([Solutions - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/solutions/#:~:text=,Arbitrary%20attitude%20hold)).

([Products - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/bluerov_upgrade/)) _Mission Robotics’ pilot software (NavX) provides an intuitive GUI for ROV operators, integrating live HD video, sensor telemetry, and controls into one interface ([Solutions - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/solutions/#:~:text=Intuitive%20Pilot%20UI)). The software supports multiple camera feeds with low latency and includes overlays for critical data (depth, heading, power, etc.), giving pilots situational awareness during underwater missions._ ([Solutions - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/solutions/#:~:text=Optimized%20Video%20Pipeline)) ([Solutions - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/solutions/#:~:text=Intuitive%20Pilot%20UI))

Another strength of the software is **data management**. All video streams and telemetry data are time-synchronized and recorded together, simplifying post-mission analysis ([Products - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/bluerov_upgrade/#:~:text=All%20data%20streams%20,processing%20and%20analysis)) ([Products - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/bluerov_upgrade/#:~:text=,additional%20context%20for%20your%20mission)). Video is saved as standard MP4 files and sensor logs as CSV, enabling straightforward review in tools like video editors or with provided Python scripts ([Products - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/bluerov_upgrade/#:~:text=,additional%20context%20for%20your%20mission)). Operators can mark important events with a button press during the dive, and later replay the entire mission exactly as it happened (video, controls, and all) to quickly locate those events ([New Product - BlueROV2 Full Electronics and Software Upgrade - Third Party Products - Blue Robotics Community Forums](https://discuss.bluerobotics.com/t/new-product-bluerov2-full-electronics-and-software-upgrade/10652#:~:text=,computers%20on%20the%20same%20network)) ([New Product - BlueROV2 Full Electronics and Software Upgrade - Third Party Products - Blue Robotics Community Forums](https://discuss.bluerobotics.com/t/new-product-bluerov2-full-electronics-and-software-upgrade/10652#:~:text=%2A%20Built,with%20virtually%20zero%20additional%20latency)). This integrated recording and “playback” functionality greatly streamlines reporting – no more manually converting and aligning disparate logs ([New Product - BlueROV2 Full Electronics and Software Upgrade - Third Party Products - Blue Robotics Community Forums](https://discuss.bluerobotics.com/t/new-product-bluerov2-full-electronics-and-software-upgrade/10652#:~:text=,computers%20on%20the%20same%20network)). Mission Robotics has even demonstrated automatic dive report generation, where a summary of depth profiles and notable events (with snapshots) can be produced right after a mission ([Products - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/bluerov_upgrade/#:~:text=,our%20strategy%20in%20this%20webinar)) ([Products - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/bluerov_upgrade/#:~:text=Image%3A%20Screenshot%20of%20dive%20report,from%20dive%20and%20depth%20profile)).

The **topside user interface** (pilot application) is built for simplicity and extensibility. It replaces the traditional QGroundControl in the BlueROV2 ecosystem with a custom GUI (code-named “NavX”) tailored to marine operations ([New Product - BlueROV2 Full Electronics and Software Upgrade - Third Party Products - Blue Robotics Community Forums](https://discuss.bluerobotics.com/t/new-product-bluerov2-full-electronics-and-software-upgrade/10652#:~:text=Topside%20Software%20)). This pilot UI displays live HD video (with the ability to switch between multiple cameras in real-time), shows telemetry readouts (e.g. depth, attitude, heading, battery), and will soon integrate sonar and map overlays ([Solutions - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/solutions/#:~:text=Intuitive%20Pilot%20UI)). Under the hood, the UI utilizes hardware-accelerated video decoding (leveraging GPU) to render 1080p60 video feeds with glass-to-glass latency under 130 ms ([New Product - BlueROV2 Full Electronics and Software Upgrade - Third Party Products - Blue Robotics Community Forums](https://discuss.bluerobotics.com/t/new-product-bluerov2-full-electronics-and-software-upgrade/10652#:~:text=,like%20coral%20reefs%20and%20sand)) ([Products - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/bluerov_upgrade/#:~:text=,graphics%2C%20with%20software%20decoding%20fallback)). This is comparable to analog video latency, a significant achievement for digital IP cameras. In fact, Mission Robotics’ camera pipeline delivers **smooth, high-quality video** (H.264 or MJPEG) with up to 60 fps at 1080p and user-controllable bitrate up to 48 Mbps, yielding far better low-light imagery and detail than typical ROV cameras ([New Product - BlueROV2 Full Electronics and Software Upgrade - Third Party Products - Blue Robotics Community Forums](https://discuss.bluerobotics.com/t/new-product-bluerov2-full-electronics-and-software-upgrade/10652#:~:text=,like%20coral%20reefs%20and%20sand)) ([New Product - BlueROV2 Full Electronics and Software Upgrade - Third Party Products - Blue Robotics Community Forums](https://discuss.bluerobotics.com/t/new-product-bluerov2-full-electronics-and-software-upgrade/10652#:~:text=than%20that%20of%20a%20BlueROV2,like%20coral%20reefs%20and%20sand)). Such performance improvements “noticeably smooth the piloting experience” for the operator ([New Product - BlueROV2 Full Electronics and Software Upgrade - Third Party Products - Blue Robotics Community Forums](https://discuss.bluerobotics.com/t/new-product-bluerov2-full-electronics-and-software-upgrade/10652#:~:text=Light%20HD%20USB%20Camera.%20,noticeably%20smooths%20the%20piloting%20experience)).

Beyond single-vehicle control, the software is built with **fleet operations and remote connectivity** in mind. It supports multi-vehicle, multi-operator scenarios over networks – whether on a local vessel or via the internet ([Solutions - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/solutions/#:~:text=Network%20Topologies%20Supported)). Automatic network discovery and DHCP addressing mean that adding a new ROV or control station requires zero manual IP configuration ([Products - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/bluerov_upgrade/#:~:text=%2A%20Over,analysis%20of%20individual%20motor%20performance)) ([New Product - BlueROV2 Full Electronics and Software Upgrade - Third Party Products - Blue Robotics Community Forums](https://discuss.bluerobotics.com/t/new-product-bluerov2-full-electronics-and-software-upgrade/10652#:~:text=,with%20virtually%20zero%20additional%20latency)). Mission Robotics also plans robust teleoperation features (leveraging DDS’s real-time WAN transport) so that ROVs can be supervised or piloted from remote locations with minimal setup ([Home Page - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/#:~:text=distribution%20of%20data,for%20new%20products%2C%20and%20provides)) ([RTI Announces the First Software Framework Designed for Widely Distributed Autonomous Systems](https://www.rti.com/news/rti-announces-software-framework-for-widely-autonomous-systems#:~:text=,is%20an%20absolute%20game%20changer)). Security and reliability for such links are inherently handled by the middleware, which can traverse NAT networks and handle dropouts gracefully ([RTI Announces the First Software Framework Designed for Widely Distributed Autonomous Systems](https://www.rti.com/news/rti-announces-software-framework-for-widely-autonomous-systems#:~:text=Connectivity%20for%20distributed%20control%20is,area%2C%20public%20and%20private%20networks)) ([RTI Announces the First Software Framework Designed for Widely Distributed Autonomous Systems](https://www.rti.com/news/rti-announces-software-framework-for-widely-autonomous-systems#:~:text=Connext%206,in%20real%20time%20without%20interruption)). This approach has been called an “absolute game changer,” as it enables persistent, real-time remote ROV operations even over unreliable connections ([RTI Announces the First Software Framework Designed for Widely Distributed Autonomous Systems](https://www.rti.com/news/rti-announces-software-framework-for-widely-autonomous-systems#:~:text=,is%20an%20absolute%20game%20changer)).

Importantly, Mission Robotics encourages **user customization and third-party integration**. The software exposes a full API via DDS, and because DDS has bindings in multiple languages (C++, Python, etc.), developers can write their own modules or scripts in the language of their choice to interface with the running vehicle ([Developers - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/developers/#:~:text=,Simulation%20capabilities%20reduce%20development%20costs)). For instance, one can subscribe to the live telemetry topics or publish commands to control the vehicle, enabling applications like autonomous navigation algorithms or computer vision routines to plug into the system ([New Product - BlueROV2 Full Electronics and Software Upgrade - Third Party Products - Blue Robotics Community Forums](https://discuss.bluerobotics.com/t/new-product-bluerov2-full-electronics-and-software-upgrade/10652#:~:text=,Nano%2C%20which%20has%20substantially%20more)). Support for ROS 2 means researchers and engineers can also leverage the vast ROS ecosystem (Gazebo simulation, RViz visualization, etc.) with Mission Robotics’ platform ([Products - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/bluerov_upgrade/#:~:text=your%20exact%20needs,such%20as%20Gazebo%20and%20RViz)). Furthermore, the company provides an Arduino/Zephyr-based **Microcontroller Bridge** that lets users add custom sensors or actuators: you can prototype your device on an Arduino, then connect it via USB to the ROV, and the software automatically creates a two-way communication channel between your device and the topside UI ([New Product - BlueROV2 Full Electronics and Software Upgrade - Third Party Products - Blue Robotics Community Forums](https://discuss.bluerobotics.com/t/new-product-bluerov2-full-electronics-and-software-upgrade/10652#:~:text=%2A%20Microcontroller%20Bridge%20,vehicle%20and%20the%20topside%20computer)). This unique feature means even non-standard payloads (a custom sonar, a new gripper, scientific sensors, etc.) can be integrated **without modifying the core system**, as the bridge will translate and ferry data/commands for you in real-time ([New Product - BlueROV2 Full Electronics and Software Upgrade - Third Party Products - Blue Robotics Community Forums](https://discuss.bluerobotics.com/t/new-product-bluerov2-full-electronics-and-software-upgrade/10652#:~:text=%2A%20Microcontroller%20Bridge%20,vehicle%20and%20the%20topside%20computer)) ([Products - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/bluerov_upgrade/#:~:text=,through%20a%20single%20USB%20connection)). Mission Robotics’ commitment to open standards and extensibility essentially turns their ROV into a **development platform** for marine robotics, allowing users to focus on their specific application while the company’s software handles the heavy lifting of vehicle control, networking, and data management ([Developers - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/developers/#:~:text=,Simulation%20capabilities%20reduce%20development%20costs)) ([Solutions - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/solutions/#:~:text=,sensor%20integrations%2C%20and%20custom%20projects)).

## Hardware Components and Technologies

On the hardware side, Mission Robotics has developed a suite of proprietary components that modernize the control and sensing capabilities of marine vehicles. At the heart of the system is a **high-performance computing module coupled with an advanced flight controller**. The main computer is an NVIDIA Jetson Nano (Quad-core ARM CPU with GPU), which offers substantially more processing power and I/O bandwidth than the Raspberry Pi 3 typically used in hobby ROVs ([Products - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/bluerov_upgrade/#:~:text=As%20vehicle%20and%20sensor%20technology,than%20the%203DR%20Pixhawk%C2%AE%201)). This upgrade enables on-board machine learning, computer vision, and the handling of multiple HD video streams simultaneously ([Products - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/bluerov_upgrade/#:~:text=By%20moving%20to%20these%20newer,capabilities%2C%20enabling%20advanced%20use%20cases)). Alongside the Jetson, the Flight Management Unit (FMU) is a next-generation microcontroller (replacing the old Pixhawk 1 autopilot) equipped with newer, higher-precision IMU sensors (gyroscope, accelerometer, magnetometer) for better stability and navigational accuracy ([Products - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/bluerov_upgrade/#:~:text=As%20vehicle%20and%20sensor%20technology,than%20the%203DR%20Pixhawk%C2%AE%201)). The integration of these newer processors has dramatically expanded the system’s input/output capabilities and real-time performance, unlocking advanced use cases like multi-camera support with no added lag and high-bandwidth peripheral integration (e.g. Doppler sonars, INS units) ([Products - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/bluerov_upgrade/#:~:text=By%20moving%20to%20these%20newer,capabilities%2C%20enabling%20advanced%20use%20cases)). In short, **the brains of Mission Robotics’ platform marry a powerful AI-capable SBC with a robust real-time controller**, providing both the intelligence and stability needed for autonomous or pilot-assisted operations.

A flagship hardware offering is the **Slide-In Electronics Module for 4″ ROV enclosures**, designed as a drop-in replacement for the BlueROV2’s internal electronics ([Solutions - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/solutions/#:~:text=Slide)). This all-in-one chassis contains the Jetson computer, the new FMU, power management, and motor controllers, all fitted onto a single unified PCB that slides neatly into a standard 4-inch ROV electronics tube ([Products - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/bluerov_upgrade/#:~:text=,temperature%20points%2C%20and%20CPU%20resource)) ([Solutions - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/solutions/#:~:text=Slide)). Upgrading a BlueROV2 is as simple as removing its existing electronics tray and inserting Mission Robotics’ module, reconnecting the thrusters and sensors – a process that can be done in a few hours ([New Product - BlueROV2 Full Electronics and Software Upgrade - Third Party Products - Blue Robotics Community Forums](https://discuss.bluerobotics.com/t/new-product-bluerov2-full-electronics-and-software-upgrade/10652#:~:text=Mission%20Robotics%20is%20pleased%20to,ROV%20within%20a%20few%20hours)). By consolidating everything on one board, there’s much less wiring and fewer failure points, which improves reliability and frees up space inside the pressure housing (over a quarter of the tube is left open for user payloads) ([New Product - BlueROV2 Full Electronics and Software Upgrade - Third Party Products - Blue Robotics Community Forums](https://discuss.bluerobotics.com/t/new-product-bluerov2-full-electronics-and-software-upgrade/10652#:~:text=configuration%20and%20a%20simple%20modification,configuration%20of%20the%20BlueROV%202)) ([New Product - BlueROV2 Full Electronics and Software Upgrade - Third Party Products - Blue Robotics Community Forums](https://discuss.bluerobotics.com/t/new-product-bluerov2-full-electronics-and-software-upgrade/10652#:~:text=,configuration%20of%20the%20BlueROV%202)). The module is engineered for **operational efficiency**: for example, it includes an **electronic power switch system** that lets the pilot power the ROV on or off from the surface control box (no need to open the battery compartment between dives) ([Products - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/bluerov_upgrade/#:~:text=,in%20the%204%20inch%20tube)). This is achieved by sending a power-on/off signal over the existing tether’s twisted pair that also carries data, with a soft shutdown sequence to avoid corrupting data logs ([Products - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/bluerov_upgrade/#:~:text=,in%20the%204%20inch%20tube)) ([Products - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/bluerov_upgrade/#:~:text=battery%2C%20while%20still%20using%20your,and%20devices%3B%20no%20more%20setting)). The power distribution on the board also provides **subsystem power switching** (so individual parts like lights or sensors can be power-cycled for reset or to shed load if battery is low) ([Products - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/bluerov_upgrade/#:~:text=reliability%20and%20eliminating%20wasted%20space,points%2C%20and%20CPU%20resource%20usage)) ([New Product - BlueROV2 Full Electronics and Software Upgrade - Third Party Products - Blue Robotics Community Forums](https://discuss.bluerobotics.com/t/new-product-bluerov2-full-electronics-and-software-upgrade/10652#:~:text=signals%20to%20a%20separate%20tube%29,Jetson%20Nano%29%2C%20and%20our)). Built-in health monitoring sensors (leak detector, internal pressure, multiple temperature and voltage/current sensors) feed into the software’s telemetry, giving operators early warning of any issues like leaks or overheating ([Products - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/bluerov_upgrade/#:~:text=vehicle%20always%20remains%20in%20a,analysis%20of%20individual%20motor%20performance)). In essence, the 4″ electronics module transforms the BlueROV2 into a “professional-grade” ROV, with higher performance and more automation than the stock configuration ([Products - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/bluerov_upgrade/#:~:text=Mission%20Robotics%20provides%20cutting,software%20for%20customization%20and%20expansion)) ([Products - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/bluerov_upgrade/#:~:text=Mission%20Robotics%20can%20turn%20a,The%20sky%20is%20the%20limit)).

([Products - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/bluerov_upgrade/)) _Mission Robotics’ 4″ Slide-In Electronics Module (shown) completely replaces a BlueROV2’s internals. It integrates the Jetson Nano computer, a new flight controller, eight ESCs, and various interface boards into a single compact chassis ([New Product - BlueROV2 Full Electronics and Software Upgrade - Third Party Products - Blue Robotics Community Forums](https://discuss.bluerobotics.com/t/new-product-bluerov2-full-electronics-and-software-upgrade/10652#:~:text=Mission%20Robotics%20is%20pleased%20to,ROV%20within%20a%20few%20hours)) ([New Product - BlueROV2 Full Electronics and Software Upgrade - Third Party Products - Blue Robotics Community Forums](https://discuss.bluerobotics.com/t/new-product-bluerov2-full-electronics-and-software-upgrade/10652#:~:text=signals%20to%20a%20separate%20tube%29,Jetson%20Nano%29%2C%20and%20our)). This plug-and-play upgrade brings advanced processing and control features to smaller ROVs without altering their frame or thrusters._ ([New Product - BlueROV2 Full Electronics and Software Upgrade - Third Party Products - Blue Robotics Community Forums](https://discuss.bluerobotics.com/t/new-product-bluerov2-full-electronics-and-software-upgrade/10652#:~:text=Mission%20Robotics%20is%20pleased%20to,ROV%20within%20a%20few%20hours)) ([New Product - BlueROV2 Full Electronics and Software Upgrade - Third Party Products - Blue Robotics Community Forums](https://discuss.bluerobotics.com/t/new-product-bluerov2-full-electronics-and-software-upgrade/10652#:~:text=signals%20to%20a%20separate%20tube%29,Jetson%20Nano%29%2C%20and%20our))

Beyond small ROV retrofits, Mission Robotics offers scalable hardware solutions for larger vehicles. They have a **re-packaged version of the core system for custom ROVs/AUVs up to ~600 kg** in size ([Solutions - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/solutions/#:~:text=Re)). This suggests a modular architecture: the computing/control core can be adapted into different form factors or enclosures to drive heavier-duty thrusters and support more complex payloads. The company has worked with integrators to customize these electronics for various vehicle designs, demonstrating the flexibility of their platform ([Products - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/bluerov_upgrade/#:~:text=Mission%20Robotics%20can%20turn%20a,The%20sky%20is%20the%20limit)) ([Solutions - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/solutions/#:~:text=Re)). All versions support the same software (Vehicle OS and Pilot interface), ensuring consistency across vehicle classes ([Solutions - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/solutions/#:~:text=Slide)) ([Solutions - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/solutions/#:~:text=,existing%20vehicles%20to%20modernize%20capabilities)).

To complement the core, Mission Robotics has developed a range of **accessory hardware boards and sensors** that extend the system’s capabilities:

- **Digital Motor Controllers (ESCs) with Telemetry:** The upgrade kit comes with eight electronic speed controllers (supporting up to 8 thrusters for vectored configurations) that communicate digitally with the FMU ([New Product - BlueROV2 Full Electronics and Software Upgrade - Third Party Products - Blue Robotics Community Forums](https://discuss.bluerobotics.com/t/new-product-bluerov2-full-electronics-and-software-upgrade/10652#:~:text=signals%20to%20a%20separate%20tube%29,Jetson%20Nano%29%2C%20and%20our)). These ESCs report real-time motor RPM, current draw, voltage, and temperature back to the system, allowing for per-thruster performance monitoring and fault detection ([New Product - BlueROV2 Full Electronics and Software Upgrade - Third Party Products - Blue Robotics Community Forums](https://discuss.bluerobotics.com/t/new-product-bluerov2-full-electronics-and-software-upgrade/10652#:~:text=signals%20to%20a%20separate%20tube%29,Jetson%20Nano%29%2C%20and%20our)). This level of feedback is valuable for diagnostics and enabling advanced control features like automatic station-keeping.
- **Isolated Power and I/O Modules:** There are plug-in boards for additional I/O and power needs. An **I/O Expander Board** provides extra interfaces (PWM outputs, analog inputs, GPIO, I²C, SPI, serial) on a second bottle or expansion housing, useful when an ROV needs many peripherals ([Solutions - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/solutions/#:~:text=I%2FO%20Expander%20Board)) ([Solutions - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/solutions/#:~:text=Isolated%20Serial%20Boards)). **Isolated Serial Interface boards** offer RS-232, RS-485, and TTL UART ports with electrical isolation, so that sensitive instruments can be added without risking ground loops or noise issues ([Solutions - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/solutions/#:~:text=Isolated%20Serial%20Boards)). Likewise, **Isolated Power Supply boards** can supply stable 5V/12V/24V power to custom add-ons, protected from the main bus, improving overall system robustness ([Solutions - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/solutions/#:~:text=Isolated%20RS232%2C%20RS485%2C%20and%20LVTTL,connect%20peripherals%20to%20the%20system)) ([Solutions - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/solutions/#:~:text=Isolated%20Power%20Supply%20Boards)).
- **Ethernet and Networking:** Recognizing the trend toward IP-based sensors (sonars, cameras, modems), Mission Robotics provides subsea Ethernet expansion. A compact **Ethernet Switch** module (100 Mb or 1 Gb options) can be integrated to network multiple devices through the single tether line ([Solutions - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/solutions/#:~:text=Image)) ([Solutions - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/solutions/#:~:text=,Electronics)). There’s also a **Dual Serial-to-Ethernet gateway**, which allows legacy serial devices to interface with the IP network seamlessly ([Solutions - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/solutions/#:~:text=Dual%20Serial%20to%20Ethernet)). All these use a CAN-based internal bus to minimize cabling (a single twisted pair can carry communications to various modules) ([Solutions - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/solutions/#:~:text=ACCESSORIES)).
- **HD Low-Light Camera**: Mission Robotics developed their own **external HD camera** optimized for underwater vision ([Solutions - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/solutions/#:~:text=External%20Camera)). It delivers 1080p video at 60 fps with very high light sensitivity (claimed four times better than the standard Blue Robotics low-light camera) ([Products - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/bluerov_upgrade/#:~:text=,graphics%2C%20with%20software%20decoding%20fallback)). The camera has an anodized aluminum housing with a sapphire lens window for scratch resistance, and it’s rated to 600 m depth ([Solutions - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/solutions/#:~:text=,Sapphire%20window%20for%20scratch%20resistance)) ([Solutions - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/solutions/#:~:text=,Sapphire%20window%20for%20scratch%20resistance)). It connects via USB or IP, and can be powered from the system with isolated supply for reliability ([Solutions - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/solutions/#:~:text=Image)). This camera, combined with the GPU-accelerated pipeline, gives exceptionally clear imagery in dark waters ([Products - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/bluerov_upgrade/#:~:text=The%20entire%20optical%20path%20has,of%20the%20most%20challenging%20environments)).

Finally, the **topside control equipment** is part of the hardware package. Mission Robotics supplies a surface control box that interfaces with the ROV tether and hosts the pilot software (on a laptop or an embedded PC). The topside box includes the remote power switch (tether power control circuit) and network connections. For example, in Poseidon Robotics’ implementation of Mission Robotics tech, the Lanai Pro ROV’s console features an _“industrial flight computer/telemetry system and rugged Linux user interface from Mission Robotics”_ built into a 22″ control station ([BeYond Survey](https://beyond-srv.com/products/poseidon-robotics-the-lanai-pro#:~:text=The%20Lanai%20Pro%20ROV%20enhances,console%2Fpro%20controller%2C%20spares%2C%20and%20cases)) ([BeYond Survey](https://beyond-srv.com/products/poseidon-robotics-the-lanai-pro#:~:text=2,Aux%20HDMI%20monitor%20output)). This kind of integration shows the hardware is not just the vehicle-side components but also robust surface systems for professional operations.

Overall, **Mission Robotics’ hardware suite replaces the traditional ROV electronics stack with a modern, integrated design**. By using powerful compute modules, a streamlined all-in-one board, and a host of expansion options, they bring capabilities normally seen in high-end industrial ROVs into a more compact and modular form. The hardware is designed to be **future-proof and upgradable** – the Jetson Nano module, for instance, can theoretically be swapped for more powerful NVIDIA SOMs down the line to support cutting-edge vision or AI tasks ([Products - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/bluerov_upgrade/#:~:text=By%20moving%20to%20these%20newer,capabilities%2C%20enabling%20advanced%20use%20cases)). The result is a hardware platform that can scale from small inspection ROVs to larger survey-class vehicles, all while running the same advanced software.

## Impact on the Marine Robotics Industry

Mission Robotics is contributing significantly to the advancement of marine robotics by bridging the gap between low-cost DIY systems and high-end commercial ROV platforms. Their approach is **driving an industry shift toward modern digital architectures** in a field that has traditionally been dominated by proprietary, closed systems. By introducing an open-standards-based solution that can be retrofitted into existing vehicles, they enable ROV operators and builders to upgrade performance without starting from scratch ([Products - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/bluerov_upgrade/#:~:text=Mission%20Robotics%20provides%20cutting,software%20for%20customization%20and%20expansion)) ([New Product - BlueROV2 Full Electronics and Software Upgrade - Third Party Products - Blue Robotics Community Forums](https://discuss.bluerobotics.com/t/new-product-bluerov2-full-electronics-and-software-upgrade/10652#:~:text=Mission%20Robotics%20is%20pleased%20to,ROV%20within%20a%20few%20hours)). This greatly **accelerates time-to-market** for new marine robot designs and feature integrations – instead of spending years developing a control system in-house, companies or research labs can build on Mission Robotics’ proven platform and focus on their specific mission payloads ([Solutions - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/solutions/#:~:text=,sensor%20integrations%2C%20and%20custom%20projects)) ([ROS2 Embarks on a Mission to the Bottom of Lake Tahoe - Maritime Robotics - ROS Discourse](https://discourse.ros.org/t/ros2-embarks-on-a-mission-to-the-bottom-of-lake-tahoe/17139#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20core%20user,to%20best%20meet%20your%20needs)). As the company puts it, their infrastructure “enables faster time-to-market for new products” and provides “unprecedented flexibility and expandability for end users” ([Home Page - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/#:~:text=We%20are%20leading%20an%20industry,and%20expandability%20for%20end%20users)).

One major impact is the **standardization of interfaces in a traditionally fragmented space**. Marine robotics often involves sensors and actuators from many manufacturers, each with its own protocol. Mission Robotics solves this by converting vendor-specific protocols into a common set of messages on their DDS network, essentially acting as a universal translator ([Service - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/service/#:~:text=,operator%20scenarios)). This means operators can mix and match equipment (sonars, cameras, manipulators, instruments) more easily, fostering a more plug-and-play ecosystem. Such interoperability is further enhanced by their embrace of ROS 2, which is emerging as a de facto standard in robotics. By being ROS 2 native, their systems can readily work with other ROS-enabled maritime projects, facilitating collaboration and integration across organizations.

Operationally, the reliability and advanced features of Mission Robotics’ solutions **increase productivity and reduce costs** for marine service providers. For example, improved reliability (robust hardware, fewer cables, health monitoring) cuts down on ROV downtime during critical operations ([Products - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/bluerov_upgrade/#:~:text=)) ([Products - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/bluerov_upgrade/#:~:text=,temperature%20points%2C%20and%20CPU%20resource)). In underwater tasks where vessel time is expensive, having an ROV that just works and can be quickly adapted to the job at hand is a huge advantage. The company highlights that “reduced downtime translates to increased profitability” for service operators ([Service - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/service/#:~:text=,operator%20scenarios)). Additionally, the time-synchronized recording and easy post-dive data processing shorten the turnaround for delivering survey results or inspection reports to clients ([Service - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/service/#:~:text=,loops%20decrease%20the%20piloting%20expertise)). With features like one-click event marking and automatic report generation (on the roadmap), operators can provide actionable information faster, which is highly valuable in industries like offshore inspection or marine research ([Products - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/bluerov_upgrade/#:~:text=,our%20strategy%20in%20this%20webinar)).

Mission Robotics is also pushing the envelope in terms of **remote and multi-vehicle operations**, which could reshape how underwater tasks are conducted. Their platform’s ability to handle multiple ROVs and pilots on the same network, and even allow over-the-internet teleoperation, opens up scenarios like expert pilots assisting local crews remotely, or orchestrating swarms of underwater drones collaboratively ([Solutions - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/solutions/#:~:text=Network%20Topologies%20Supported)) ([Home Page - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/#:~:text=distribution%20of%20data,for%20new%20products%2C%20and%20provides)). This not only expands the reach of ROV services (e.g., an expert can supervise worldwide operations from a control center) but also improves safety by keeping humans out of hazardous environments while still maintaining oversight. The incorporation of DDS’s real-time WAN transport for remote control is an industry first, addressing a long-standing challenge of undersea robotics – maintaining control over unreliable networks ([RTI Announces the First Software Framework Designed for Widely Distributed Autonomous Systems](https://www.rti.com/news/rti-announces-software-framework-for-widely-autonomous-systems#:~:text=Connectivity%20for%20distributed%20control%20is,area%2C%20public%20and%20private%20networks)) ([RTI Announces the First Software Framework Designed for Widely Distributed Autonomous Systems](https://www.rti.com/news/rti-announces-software-framework-for-widely-autonomous-systems#:~:text=,is%20an%20absolute%20game%20changer)). By solving this, Mission Robotics contributes to broader adoption of semi-autonomous and remote-supervised systems in marine industries, analogous to trends in autonomous vehicles and drones.

Another aspect of industry impact is **educational and research access**. By planning to open-source significant portions of their software and providing a ROS2-based development platform, Mission Robotics offers universities and labs a ready-made solution for marine robotics research ([ROS2 Embarks on a Mission to the Bottom of Lake Tahoe - Maritime Robotics - ROS Discourse](https://discourse.ros.org/t/ros2-embarks-on-a-mission-to-the-bottom-of-lake-tahoe/17139#:~:text=To%20provide%20a%20bit%20of,technology%20in%20the%20marine%20space)) ([ROS2 Embarks on a Mission to the Bottom of Lake Tahoe - Maritime Robotics - ROS Discourse](https://discourse.ros.org/t/ros2-embarks-on-a-mission-to-the-bottom-of-lake-tahoe/17139#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20core%20user,to%20best%20meet%20your%20needs)). Instead of each lab cobbling together a custom ROV control system, they can use this platform to jump straight into experimenting with new control algorithms, sensors, or AI, confident that the underlying vehicle will reliably handle the basics. This can accelerate research in underwater autonomy, mapping, habitat monitoring, and more. The company has explicitly targeted research institutions as key users, aiming to provide a “modern, marine-focused development platform” with all the familiar tools of mainstream robotics ([ROS2 Embarks on a Mission to the Bottom of Lake Tahoe - Maritime Robotics - ROS Discourse](https://discourse.ros.org/t/ros2-embarks-on-a-mission-to-the-bottom-of-lake-tahoe/17139#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20core%20user,to%20best%20meet%20your%20needs)). This could spur more innovation and talent in the marine robotics field, as students and engineers get to work with professional-grade tools at lower cost.

Finally, Mission Robotics’ work exemplifies how **cross-pollination from other industries** (like aerospace and autonomous cars) can benefit marine technology. Features such as modular software updates (including OTA updates with integrity checks) ([Products - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/bluerov_upgrade/#:~:text=,temperature%20points%2C%20and%20CPU%20resource)), containerized development (Docker & CI/CD pipelines on the roadmap) ([Products - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/bluerov_upgrade/#:~:text=,both%20frontend%20and%20vehicle%20development)), and high-speed networking were uncommon in the small ROV arena before. Their success in implementing these shows the marine sector evolving towards more agile, software-defined systems, much like other tech sectors. By leading this change, Mission Robotics likely pressures other ROV manufacturers to modernize as well, ultimately advancing the state-of-the-art for all marine robotics. As they proudly note, they are “leading an industry shift towards modern digital hardware and the latest software techniques” in the marine domain ([Home Page - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/#:~:text=SOLUTIONS)) – a shift that is enabling new capabilities and business models in ocean exploration, offshore energy, aquaculture, and beyond.

## Notable Projects and Collaborations

Mission Robotics has been involved in a number of notable projects and partnerships that demonstrate the capabilities of their technology. One headline achievement was their **Lake Tahoe deep-dive project** in late 2020, which served as a proof-of-concept for their ROS 2-based ROV system. The Mission Robotics team built a custom ROV (using a BlueROV2 frame outfitted with their hardware and software) and set out to reach the bottom of Lake Tahoe – about 500 m deep, making it the second-deepest lake in the U.S. ([ROS2 Embarks on a Mission to the Bottom of Lake Tahoe - Maritime Robotics - ROS Discourse](https://discourse.ros.org/t/ros2-embarks-on-a-mission-to-the-bottom-of-lake-tahoe/17139#:~:text=About%2010%20days%20ago%2C%20we,and%20built%20by%20Blue%20Robotics)). After a series of test dives to 100 m, 200 m, 300 m, and 450 m to validate the system, they successfully achieved the goal of descending to roughly 500 m depth ([ROS2 Embarks on a Mission to the Bottom of Lake Tahoe - Maritime Robotics - ROS Discourse](https://discourse.ros.org/t/ros2-embarks-on-a-mission-to-the-bottom-of-lake-tahoe/17139#:~:text=In%20the%20weeks%20leading%20up,confidence%20to%20go%20the%20distance)). This endeavor was likely a **record-setting ROS 2 deployment** in terms of depth. It proved the reliability of their platform under extreme conditions: cold temperatures, high pressure, and long tether lengths. Observers noted that ROS 2 with Cyclone DDS “holds up under pressure – 500 m down at the bottom of Lake Tahoe thanks to the great folks at Mission Robotics” ([ROS2 Embarks on a Mission to the Bottom of Lake Tahoe - Maritime Robotics - ROS Discourse](https://discourse.ros.org/t/ros2-embarks-on-a-mission-to-the-bottom-of-lake-tahoe/17139#:~:text=Awesome%21%20ROS%202%20with%20Eclipse,great%20folks%20at%20Mission%20Robotics)). The dive not only showcased the robust teleoperation (the ROV was controlled and monitored in real-time throughout the descent) but also produced valuable footage and data from depths rarely seen by low-cost ROVs. This project illustrated Mission Robotics’ commitment to pushing boundaries and was a strong validation of their technology in a real-world expedition.

([Mission Robotics ROV dives into ROS 2 Foxy - ros2 - ROS Discourse](https://discourse.ros.org/t/mission-robotics-rov-dives-into-ros-2-foxy/15830)) _Mission Robotics built a ROS2-powered ROV (based on the BlueROV2 platform, shown above) that successfully dove to ~500 m in Lake Tahoe, demonstrating the system’s reliability at extreme depths ([ROS2 Embarks on a Mission to the Bottom of Lake Tahoe - Maritime Robotics - ROS Discourse](https://discourse.ros.org/t/ros2-embarks-on-a-mission-to-the-bottom-of-lake-tahoe/17139#:~:text=About%2010%20days%20ago%2C%20we,and%20built%20by%20Blue%20Robotics)) ([ROS2 Embarks on a Mission to the Bottom of Lake Tahoe - Maritime Robotics - ROS Discourse](https://discourse.ros.org/t/ros2-embarks-on-a-mission-to-the-bottom-of-lake-tahoe/17139#:~:text=Awesome%21%20ROS%202%20with%20Eclipse,great%20folks%20at%20Mission%20Robotics)). The ROV utilized Mission Robotics’ custom electronics and software for control, and completed several test dives before reaching the lakebed (~1839 ft), a new milestone for ROS2 in underwater robotics._ ([ROS2 Embarks on a Mission to the Bottom of Lake Tahoe - Maritime Robotics - ROS Discourse](https://discourse.ros.org/t/ros2-embarks-on-a-mission-to-the-bottom-of-lake-tahoe/17139#:~:text=About%2010%20days%20ago%2C%20we,and%20built%20by%20Blue%20Robotics)) ([ROS2 Embarks on a Mission to the Bottom of Lake Tahoe - Maritime Robotics - ROS Discourse](https://discourse.ros.org/t/ros2-embarks-on-a-mission-to-the-bottom-of-lake-tahoe/17139#:~:text=Awesome%21%20ROS%202%20with%20Eclipse,great%20folks%20at%20Mission%20Robotics))

In terms of collaborations, **Poseidon Robotics**, an ROV manufacturer in Arizona, has partnered with Mission Robotics to enhance their inspection-class vehicles. Poseidon’s flagship **Lanai ROV** (and the upgraded Lanai Pro) integrate Mission Robotics’ control system as a core component. According to a product description, the Lanai Pro incorporates _“an industrial flight computer, telemetry system, and rugged Linux user interface from Mission Robotics”_ as part of its design ([BeYond Survey](https://beyond-srv.com/products/poseidon-robotics-the-lanai-pro#:~:text=The%20Lanai%20Pro%20ROV%20enhances,console%2Fpro%20controller%2C%20spares%2C%20and%20cases)). This gives the Lanai Pro advanced capabilities beyond the standard model – notably higher power handling (with a 2 kW surface power supply) and superior vehicle stabilization. In fact, Poseidon highlights that the Lanai Pro can maintain stability in any orientation (“stabilized in any attitude, thanks to Mission Robotics” as they put it) ([POSEIDON ROBOTICS, LLC - Lanai ROV, Inspection ROV, Rov](https://poseidonrov.com/videos#:~:text=)). This is a direct benefit of Mission Robotics’ attitude control and auto-hold features. The collaboration demonstrates how Mission Robotics’ tech can be OEM-integrated into third-party ROVs to quickly add features like multi-Ethernet telemetry, additional cameras, and a modern topside interface. Poseidon showcased these ROVs at industry events (like the 2023 WorkBoat Show), and they are being deployed in tasks ranging from high-current inspections to deep-water operations ([WorkBoat showcase: Poseidon Robotics displays ROV fleet at UI pavilion | WorkBoat](https://www.workboat.com/international-workboat-show/workboat-showcase-poseidon-robotics-displays-rov-fleet-at-ui-pavilion#:~:text=subsea%20systems%20and%20components,water%20operations)) ([WorkBoat showcase: Poseidon Robotics displays ROV fleet at UI pavilion | WorkBoat](https://www.workboat.com/international-workboat-show/workboat-showcase-poseidon-robotics-displays-rov-fleet-at-ui-pavilion#:~:text=The%20company%20also%20offers%20the,to%20different%20environments%20and%20missions)). For Mission Robotics, such partnerships expand the adoption of their platform and validate its use in commercial products offered to end customers.

Another notable area of deployment is in projects requiring **high-end sensor integration**. Mission Robotics’ system has been used by clients to integrate **survey-grade inertial navigation systems** on their ROVs. Walt Holm of Mission Robotics shared an example on the Blue Robotics forums: multiple customer vehicles were fitted with Sonardyne’s SPRINT-Nav Mini (a combined INS/DVL unit), and the Mission Robotics software was able to natively utilize this data for enhanced positioning and control ([Integrating Sonardyne Sprint Mini H-NAV Data with BlueOS - Sonar and Acoustics - Blue Robotics Community Forums](https://discuss.bluerobotics.com/t/integrating-sonardyne-sprint-mini-h-nav-data-with-blueos/16606#:~:text=It%20sounds%20like%20you%20are,into%20the%20Ardusub%20stack%2C%20so)) ([Integrating Sonardyne Sprint Mini H-NAV Data with BlueOS - Sonar and Acoustics - Blue Robotics Community Forums](https://discuss.bluerobotics.com/t/integrating-sonardyne-sprint-mini-h-nav-data-with-blueos/16606#:~:text=For%20the%20past%20few%20years,Nav%20Mini)). These INS sensors greatly outperform the basic IMUs in typical Pixhawk controllers, but integrating them into the standard ArduSub/BlueOS stack was not straightforward for the customers. Mission Robotics provided a solution by replacing the stock ArduSub control system with their own stack, which readily accepted the precise navigation data and improved the ROVs’ control-loop performance (e.g. holding position with DVL/INS feedback) ([Integrating Sonardyne Sprint Mini H-NAV Data with BlueOS - Sonar and Acoustics - Blue Robotics Community Forums](https://discuss.bluerobotics.com/t/integrating-sonardyne-sprint-mini-h-nav-data-with-blueos/16606#:~:text=vehicles%20running%20the%20SPRINT,they%20gave%20us%20a%20call)) ([Integrating Sonardyne Sprint Mini H-NAV Data with BlueOS - Sonar and Acoustics - Blue Robotics Community Forums](https://discuss.bluerobotics.com/t/integrating-sonardyne-sprint-mini-h-nav-data-with-blueos/16606#:~:text=For%20the%20past%20few%20years,Nav%20Mini)). This deployment, in **commercial settings over the past few years**, shows the platform’s versatility in accommodating cutting-edge sensors that require higher throughput and better sensor-fusion algorithms than legacy ROV controllers could offer ([Integrating Sonardyne Sprint Mini H-NAV Data with BlueOS - Sonar and Acoustics - Blue Robotics Community Forums](https://discuss.bluerobotics.com/t/integrating-sonardyne-sprint-mini-h-nav-data-with-blueos/16606#:~:text=vehicles%20running%20the%20SPRINT,they%20gave%20us%20a%20call)) ([Integrating Sonardyne Sprint Mini H-NAV Data with BlueOS - Sonar and Acoustics - Blue Robotics Community Forums](https://discuss.bluerobotics.com/t/integrating-sonardyne-sprint-mini-h-nav-data-with-blueos/16606#:~:text=For%20the%20past%20few%20years,Nav%20Mini)). It effectively demonstrates a case study where a marine operator upgraded an existing ROV with Mission Robotics hardware/software to achieve a new level of accuracy for subsea survey work. The success of these projects bolsters Mission Robotics’ reputation in the industry as the go-to upgrade path when off-the-shelf ROVs hit their limits in performance or integration capability.

Additionally, Mission Robotics has engaged with the wider tech community through **webinars and open-source contributions**. They have presented their approach to building extensible autonomous systems (for example, a webinar in collaboration with Integrated Computer Solutions discussed leveraging open standards like DDS in Mission Robotics’ architecture) ([Products - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/bluerov_upgrade/#:~:text=by%20getting%20critical%20data%20to,such%20as%20Gazebo%20and%20RViz)) ([On-Demand: Leveraging Open Standards to Build Highly Extensible Autonomous Systems | ICS](https://www.ics.com/demand-leveraging-open-standards-build-highly-extensible-autonomous-systems#:~:text=On,Build%20Highly%20Extensible%20Autonomous%20Systems)). The team also actively participates in ROS 2 discussions, contributing feedback and improvements (they became early adopters of Eclipse Cyclone DDS, even helping that project as needed) ([Mission Robotics ROV dives into ROS 2 Foxy - ros2 - ROS Discourse](https://discourse.ros.org/t/mission-robotics-rov-dives-into-ros-2-foxy/15830#:~:text=Mission%20Robotics%20submersible%20ROV%20running,of%20Eclipse%20Foundation%20Eclipse%20IoT)). These activities indicate a collaborative mindset – they aren’t developing in isolation but are influencing and drawing from the best practices in robotics and distributed systems.

Overall, the projects and partnerships above highlight Mission Robotics’ **real-world impact**: from record-setting deep dives and integrations in new ROV product lines, to solving complex customer challenges in underwater navigation. Each success story reinforces the value of their integrated approach to marine robotics and paves the way for broader adoption in the ocean technology community.

## Technical Details: Technology Stack and Interoperability

**Technology Stack:** Mission Robotics’ software stack is built primarily on C++ and Python, leveraging the ROS 2 framework. The core runtime is based on ROS 2 Foxy Fitzroy, which runs on Ubuntu Linux (commonly Ubuntu 18.04/20.04 on the Jetson Nano, with support for Debian-based OS as well) ([ROS2 Embarks on a Mission to the Bottom of Lake Tahoe - Maritime Robotics - ROS Discourse](https://discourse.ros.org/t/ros2-embarks-on-a-mission-to-the-bottom-of-lake-tahoe/17139#:~:text=On%20the%20software%20front%2C%20we,achieved%20via%20building%20from%20source)). By building on ROS 2, the system inherently uses DDS (Data Distribution Service) as its underlying communication layer. Specifically, the team has favored **Eclipse Cyclone DDS** as their ROS middleware implementation for its performance in their use case ([ROS2 Embarks on a Mission to the Bottom of Lake Tahoe - Maritime Robotics - ROS Discourse](https://discourse.ros.org/t/ros2-embarks-on-a-mission-to-the-bottom-of-lake-tahoe/17139#:~:text=On%20the%20software%20front%2C%20we,achieved%20via%20building%20from%20source)). DDS provides a decentralized, publish-subscribe messaging model with Quality of Service (QoS) controls, which is ideal for real-time sensor and command data on the ROV. This means all components (the topside GUI, the vehicle control processes, user-added modules, etc.) can exchange data in a many-to-many fashion without needing explicit message broker servers. The DDS setup allows dynamic discovery – when the ROV and the control station connect on the same network, they automatically find each other and start communicating using predefined topics (for example, a topic for navigation data, one for video frames, one for actuator commands) ([New Product - BlueROV2 Full Electronics and Software Upgrade - Third Party Products - Blue Robotics Community Forums](https://discuss.bluerobotics.com/t/new-product-bluerov2-full-electronics-and-software-upgrade/10652#:~:text=,with%20virtually%20zero%20additional%20latency)). This design makes the system highly **scalable and modular**; adding a second control client or a second ROV is trivial, as they’ll join the DDS domain and participate in the data exchange with unique IDs but no custom reconfiguration needed ([New Product - BlueROV2 Full Electronics and Software Upgrade - Third Party Products - Blue Robotics Community Forums](https://discuss.bluerobotics.com/t/new-product-bluerov2-full-electronics-and-software-upgrade/10652#:~:text=,with%20virtually%20zero%20additional%20latency)) ([Solutions - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/solutions/#:~:text=Network%20Topologies%20Supported)).

On top of DDS, Mission Robotics provides a rich API. They indicate that any and all vehicle functions are accessible via the DDS interface – effectively an **open API to the ROV** ([New Product - BlueROV2 Full Electronics and Software Upgrade - Third Party Products - Blue Robotics Community Forums](https://discuss.bluerobotics.com/t/new-product-bluerov2-full-electronics-and-software-upgrade/10652#:~:text=,Nano%2C%20which%20has%20substantially%20more)). For example, if a developer wants to write an autonomous dive script, they can use the DDS API to subscribe to depth and orientation, and publish heading or thrust setpoints. This API is language-agnostic; DDS client libraries exist for C++, Python, Java, and more ([Developers - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/developers/#:~:text=,Simulation%20capabilities%20reduce%20development%20costs)). For microcontroller integration, Mission Robotics uses **micro-ROS (ROS 2 for microcontrollers)** and the Zephyr RTOS on the auxiliary MCU side ([ROS2 Embarks on a Mission to the Bottom of Lake Tahoe - Maritime Robotics - ROS Discourse](https://discourse.ros.org/t/ros2-embarks-on-a-mission-to-the-bottom-of-lake-tahoe/17139#:~:text=simultaneously%20,deploying%20software%20to%20your%20system)). This allows an Arduino-class device to natively speak DDS messages (through a lightweight client) and thus appear as just another node in the ROS 2 network. It’s a clever way to bring low-level hardware into the fold without complex bridging code.

The **vehicle-side software** (running on the Jetson and FMU) is a combination of real-time control software and higher-level ROS 2 nodes. The FMU likely runs a real-time loop (possibly a custom flight control firmware or something like an RTOS application) for critical control, which communicates with the Jetson over a bus (could be serial, CAN, or Ethernet). The Jetson runs the ROS 2 nodes for things like state estimation, video handling, user interface relay, logging, and mission logic. Given that ArduSub (the open-source autopilot) is not used, Mission Robotics wrote their own control firmware that probably implements PID loops for depth/attitude, thruster mixing, etc., using the modern IMU data. They’ve ensured **all such data is injected into the DDS network** – for instance, the IMU, pressure sensor, etc. publish their data, and control setpoints can be sent as DDS topics. In this sense, their stack is truly distributed and **data-centric** (typical of DDS systems), as opposed to the point-to-point MAVLink protocol used by traditional ROVs. In fact, their stack replaces ArduSub, the Raspberry Pi companion computer software, and QGroundControl (MAVLink-based) entirely ([Integrating Sonardyne Sprint Mini H-NAV Data with BlueOS - Sonar and Acoustics - Blue Robotics Community Forums](https://discuss.bluerobotics.com/t/integrating-sonardyne-sprint-mini-h-nav-data-with-blueos/16606#:~:text=commercial%20settings%20using%20survey,Nav%20Mini)). This means no MAVLink is needed; instead, DDS (with ROS 2 message types) carries all information, which is far more scalable for complex systems.

For **communications protocols**, aside from DDS, the system naturally interfaces with standard network and bus protocols. Internally, they utilize CAN bus for connecting certain modules (like the thruster ESCs and expansion boards) on a single tether pair ([Solutions - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/solutions/#:~:text=ACCESSORIES)). CAN is robust in noisy environments and supports multi-drop, so it’s well-suited to linking multiple devices (ESCs, actuators, etc.) in the vehicle with minimal wiring. Many of the accessory boards use CAN to communicate back to the main board, reducing the wiring to essentially power and one data pair for many devices ([Solutions - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/solutions/#:~:text=ACCESSORIES)). Externally, Ethernet is a key backbone – the tether carries Ethernet signaling (either 100 Mbps or gigabit, depending on configuration). The support for multiple Ethernet devices via a subsea switch indicates the tether can handle an IP network, not just a single link ([Solutions - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/solutions/#:~:text=,Electronics)) ([BeYond Survey](https://beyond-srv.com/products/poseidon-robotics-the-lanai-pro#:~:text=8,Power%3A%205%2F12%2F24VDC%20regulated)). On the tether, Mission Robotics takes advantage of advanced networking: their adoption of **Real-Time WAN Transport** (a feature of RTI Connext DDS) means the DDS domain can be extended over the internet efficiently ([RTI Announces the First Software Framework Designed for Widely Distributed Autonomous Systems](https://www.rti.com/news/rti-announces-software-framework-for-widely-autonomous-systems#:~:text=Connext%206,in%20real%20time%20without%20interruption)) ([RTI Announces the First Software Framework Designed for Widely Distributed Autonomous Systems](https://www.rti.com/news/rti-announces-software-framework-for-widely-autonomous-systems#:~:text=,is%20an%20absolute%20game%20changer)). This uses UDP with adaptive reliability to traverse WANs and firewalls. The system also uses **Cloud Discovery Service** in DDS when needed to help nodes find each other over the internet if multicast discovery isn’t available ([RTI Announces the First Software Framework Designed for Widely Distributed Autonomous Systems](https://www.rti.com/news/rti-announces-software-framework-for-widely-autonomous-systems#:~:text=Connext%206,in%20real%20time%20without%20interruption)) ([RTI Announces the First Software Framework Designed for Widely Distributed Autonomous Systems](https://www.rti.com/news/rti-announces-software-framework-for-widely-autonomous-systems#:~:text=local%20%28LAN%29%20and%20wide,control%20of%20remote%20autonomous%20systems)). All of these are cutting-edge networking techniques for robotics, ensuring that whether the ROV is on the deck of a ship (LAN) or being controlled from hundreds of miles away (WAN), the communication remains secure, low-latency, and robust.

Interoperability with other marine systems is a major design consideration. By using ROS 2 message standards, Mission Robotics’ gear can interoperate with other ROS based systems such as autonomous surface vessels or unmanned aerial drones that might be part of a joint operation. For example, data from the ROV could be fed into a larger situational awareness system on a ship via ROS 2, or commands could be issued from a remote ROS 2 node (such as a shore-based control center). This was much harder to do with older proprietary ROV control systems. The **open API** also means integration with existing marine infrastructure like acoustic modems or topside SCADA systems is feasible – one can write interface nodes to bridge DDS data to those external systems. Indeed, the company’s tagline of providing “infrastructure for marine vehicles and instruments, scalable from small probes to work-class ROVs” suggests they envision their tech being a backbone that others build upon ([Home Page - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/#:~:text=We%20are%20leading%20an%20industry,for%20new%20products%2C%20and%20provides)).

Additionally, Mission Robotics deliberately maintained compatibility with Blue Robotics’ ecosystem where possible. Physically, their module fits the BlueROV2, and **interface compatibility with Blue Robotics accessories** (sensors like sonars, grippers, lights) was preserved ([Products - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/bluerov_upgrade/#:~:text=,easily%20integrated%20into%20the%20vehicle)). Connectors and pinouts often follow Blue Robotics standards (e.g. the camera and peripheral connectors use the same JST-GH connectors for plug-and-play) ([Solutions - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/solutions/#:~:text=Image)). This means a user can take an existing payload (say a science payload that was made for BlueROV2) and integrate it into the Mission Robotics system with minimal fuss. By not forcing a proprietary connector system, they enhance interoperability on the hardware side as well.

In terms of the **development tools**, Mission Robotics hinted at providing an SDK and even Docker-based development environments for users in the future ([Products - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/bluerov_upgrade/#:~:text=,both%20frontend%20and%20vehicle%20development)). This indicates that they might containerize their software (each ROS/DDS component could be a container) and allow users to deploy custom containers alongside theirs, or run simulations using the same Docker images. The use of Docker and CI/CD is not yet common in marine robotics, so this is a forward-looking technical detail that can ensure consistency between what is tested in simulation and what runs in the field.

Finally, security is a technical aspect worth noting. While not deeply discussed in available sources, DDS middleware like RTI Connext offers security plugins (encryption, authentication) which likely can be utilized for sensitive operations. Since Mission Robotics aims for teleoperation over public internet, they presumably include secure modes (the RTI WAN transport they use is noted to be secure and reliable ([RTI Announces the First Software Framework Designed for Widely Distributed Autonomous Systems](https://www.rti.com/news/rti-announces-software-framework-for-widely-autonomous-systems#:~:text=Connext%206,in%20real%20time%20without%20interruption))). The use of an **API abstraction** (DDS) means that developers don’t have to manually implement security at the message level; it can be configured in the middleware. This is a critical technical feature for industry acceptance, especially if their systems were to be used in defense or critical infrastructure monitoring.

In summary, Mission Robotics’ technical stack is a **blend of modern robotics software (ROS 2/DDS), robust networking, and flexible hardware interfacing**. By choosing open standards and focusing on interoperability, they have made it possible for their marine robotic systems to communicate and work in harmony with a wide range of devices and networks. Whether it’s integrating a new sensor via a standardized message bus, or handing off control of an ROV to a remote operator over a satellite link, the system is built to accommodate it. This level of interoperability and technical sophistication is a strong differentiator in the marine industry, moving it closer to the plug-and-play, networked paradigm seen in other tech domains. As their deployments and partnerships have shown, the Mission Robotics platform can effectively serve as the **technical backbone for next-generation marine operations**, driving forward what underwater robots can do and how we use them ([Solutions - Mission Robotics](https://www.missionrobotics.us/solutions/#:~:text=,sensor%20integrations%2C%20and%20custom%20projects)) ([BeYond Survey](https://beyond-srv.com/products/poseidon-robotics-the-lanai-pro#:~:text=The%20Lanai%20Pro%20ROV%20enhances,console%2Fpro%20controller%2C%20spares%2C%20and%20cases)).
